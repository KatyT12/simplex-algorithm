Doing the simplex algorithm takes too long and it is so easy to make mistakes so I made this program to make my Descision Maths homework less painful. This does the long table part of the algorithm it does not do the first part where you get the slack variables but that takes like a second anyway. if you have greater than constraints you would have to change this algorithm, maybe I will edit it to work with greater than constraints if I have time.

$  g++ Simplex.cpp -o Simplex.exec

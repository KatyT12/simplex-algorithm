Doing the simplex algorithm takes too long and it is so easy to make mistakes so I made this program to make my Decision Maths homework less painful. This does the long table part of the algorithm it does not do the first part where you get the slack variables but that takes like a second anyway. It also can do two stage simplex method when you have greater than constraints and artificial variables. When it asks if you have artificial variables just type 'y' and then enter the function for minimising the artificial variables like you would do for the other rows on the table
